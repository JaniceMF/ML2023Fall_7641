OBJECTS

Analyze TWO classification problems by using five learning algorithms, which are decision tress with some form of pruning, neural networks, boosting, support vector machines nad k-nearest neighbors. This assignment includes two datasets, which are housingpredict and emoji. They are selected from https://kaggle.com/datasets/. 

PURPOSE

With my deepest interesting, I chose these two datasets for this assignment. First of all, under current circumstance, the residence price is soaring crossing the country and real estate marketing is heating up during the Covin pandemic. The dataset of Housingpredict chooses 13 attributes. I would like to analyze how predicting price goes by using different machine learning algorithms. Second, emoji is the most popular writing message via communication. It can bring a lot of fun and enjoyment to daily life.
