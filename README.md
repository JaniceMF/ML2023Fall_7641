OBJECTS

Analyze TWO classification problems by using five learning algorithms, which are decision tress with some form of pruning, neural networks, boosting, support vector machines nad k-nearest neighbors. This assignment includes two datasets, which are housingpredict and emoji. They are selected from https://kaggle.com/datasets/. With my deepest interesting, I chose these two dataset for this assignment. First of all, under current circumstance, the house price is soaring cross the country. I would like to analyze how predicting price goes by using different algorithms. Second, emoji is the most popular writing message by communication. It can bring a lot of fun and enjoyment to daily life.
